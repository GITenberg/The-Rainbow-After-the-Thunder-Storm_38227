<h2>THE RAINBOW,<br />
<span class='small'>AFTER</span><br />
THE THUNDER-STORM.</h2>


<p>JULIA and her mamma resided chiefly
in London. Owing to indisposition the
family were a little way from home for the
benefit of the air. In consequence of that,
Julia and her mamma were frequently
walking out. One summer's evening they
had extended their walk to an unusual<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
length, when suddenly the clouds gathered,
and distant thunder indicated an approaching
storm. They were a great way from
any house, but hurried to the nearest one
for shelter. It was a large brick-built house,
with a court-yard, inclosed by a high wall.
At the iron gate was a servant, with a pitcher
in her hand, taking some milk of a man
who stood by. Julia's mamma went up to
her, and said, "Will you be so obliging as
to let us have a shelter from the storm?
It appears likely to be very severe." The
servant replied, "I am very sorry, ma'am,
but it is not in my power; my master and
mistress are not at home, and they have
given me orders not to admit any stranger."</p>

<p>There was no time to hesitate; immediately
they proceeded to an unfinished
house they recollected to have seen; it
was a quarter of a mile distant. Almost
breathless with fatigue, they arrived; the
wash-house door was standing open, they
entered, and thought themselves happy in
having so good a shelter. "Oh," said
Julia, "how cruel it was in that young
woman to refuse to let us go into the house!
I would not have done so." "Then," replied
her mamma, "you would have done wrong;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
however painful it must have been to her,
to refuse was no more than her duty as a
faithful servant."</p>

<p>Every minute the lightning became more
vivid, and the thunder appeared to be
bursting over their heads. "Oh, mamma,"
said Julia, "how awful this is!" "Yes,
it is indeed, my dear," said her mamma;
"God thundereth marvellously with his
voice; great wonders doeth he, which we
cannot comprehend." "This is a storm,"
remarked Julia, "such as I never remember
before. Hark! how it thunders. Oh,
what a dreadful flash of lightning! Oh,
the thunder! It gets worse; how shall I
bear it! Hide me, hide me, my dear
mamma; let me get into some dark place."
"My dear love," said her mamma, "you
surprise me to see you so alarmed; it is
what I did not expect; don't give way to
fear; <i>I</i> cannot hide you from this storm any
more than I can hide you from the presence
of God; and that you are sure I
cannot do. Be composed, my love, and let
each of us say&mdash;</p>

<div class='poem'>
'Hide me, O my Saviour, hide,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Till the storm of life is past;</span><br />
Safe into the haven guide,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">O receive my soul at last!'</span><br />
</div><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span></p>

<div class='unindent'>Our father sits at the helm; he will guide
the storm, and I shall say to you as our
Lord said to his disciples when <i>they</i> were in
a storm, and as he says to us now in his
word, "Why are ye so fearful, have ye no
faith?" Let us put our trust in <i>him</i>, and
look for our protection from <i>him</i>. How
much tenderness was there in our Lord's
words! He did not blame them much for
their fears, but kindly reminded them that
it was their duty to trust in God. You are
not like your little brother when <i>he</i> was
about four years old. I was out with him
when it thundered, and he said, 'Don't
be afraid mamma; if we love God, nothing
can hurt us.'"</div>

<p>"It makes me tremble so much," said
Julia. "If a storm like this is so awful,
my dear," said her mamma, "what must
the second coming of Christ be, when the
elements shall melt with fervent heat, the
earth also, and all the works that are therein
shall he burned up! How will the sinner
tremble, and call to the mountains and
rocks, 'Fall on us, and hide us from the face
of him that sitteth on the throne, and from
the wrath of the lamb!' Now we need not
try to hide ourselves, but if we love the
Saviour, may say<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>&mdash;</p>

<div class='poem'>
'This awful God is ours,<br />
Our father, and our love.'<br /><br />
</div>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">
<img src="images/i007.png" width="500" height="396" alt="hiding from the storm" title="" />
</div>

<p>"I think the thunder is more distant,"
continued her mamma, "and does not
succeed the lightning so soon." "Does
that make any difference?" asked Julia.
"It proves, my dear," answered her
mamma, "that the cloud is going from us;
but I observed you were more afraid of the
thunder than of the lightning; when you
hear the thunder, the danger is over. It is
only the <i>lightning</i> that is fatal. When we<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
have seen the lightning, but have not been
touched by it, and when the thunder does
not come immediately after it, it is foolish
to turn pale and tremble at a sound which
is not dangerous. After the flash of lightning
is over, we may securely wait for the
clap of thunder; it is as harmless as the
sound of a cannon. The thunder tells us
we have escaped the danger, and at the
same time informs us at what distance; for
the greater space of time there has been
between the flash of lightning and the
thunder, the more distant the storm."</p>

<p>Julia's mamma proceeded, "I heard a
poor woman once say she thought God was
angry with the people, and had sent a
storm to punish them. That is, however,
a very ignorant way of talking. Storms
are a blessing, and we ought to be thankful
for them; and though we know they
sometimes do hurt, and a few lives are lost,
yet how few compared with what might be
expected! Out of seven hundred and fifty
thousand persons who died in the space of
thirty years in London, there were only two
killed by lightning. Probably if there
were no storms, the air would be so impure,
that men and other living creatures
would perish by millions. Let us, my dear,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
lift up our hearts in gratitude to the Almighty,
who, though he sometimes shows
us his grandeur and his glory in this manner,
yet always displays more of <i>mercy</i>
than of <i>judgment</i>. After all, God has more
glory and greatness than he shows to us;
what, then, will be the manifestations of
them, when in another world we see him
face to face! Yet what we shall behold of
him there will fill us with <i>delight</i>, and not
<i>terror</i>, as I heard you singing the other day,
my dear&mdash;</p>

<div class='poem'>
'Millions of years my wond'ring eyes<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Shall o'er thy beauties rove,</span><br />
And endless ages I'll adore<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The glories of thy love.</span><br />
<br />
Sweet Jesus! ev'ry smile of thine<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Shall fresh endearments bring,</span><br />
And thousand tastes of new delight<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">From all thy graces spring.'</span><br />
</div>

<div class='unindent'>May we be prepared for that period, and
enjoy all that blessedness described in
those beautiful lines! There, my dear,
will be no storms, and we shall have no
fear." "I thank you, my dear mamma,
for talking so to me," said Julia; "I have
not felt so much fear since you began."</div>

<p>The rain had nearly ceased, and the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
storm was gone. Julia and her mamma
were glad to prepare for going home. As
soon as they entered the field leading to
their home, Julia remarked how refreshed
every thing appeared. "Yes," said her
mamma, "nature never appears more
lovely than after a Thunder-storm. The
herbage of the field is revived, and what
before was fading is refreshed. All animals
seem to rejoice; birds are coming
from their shelter, and are singing delightfully,
though it is nearly their time for rest;
and the cattle share in the general pleasure.
See those two lambs, how prettily they
are playing!"</p>

<h2>THE RAINBOW.</h2>


<p><span class="smcap">It</span> was at this moment Julia looked
around to admire the scenery, and beheld
a Rainbow. "Look, look!" she said,
"mamma, what a beautiful Rainbow! How
wide it spreads! How many colours are
there? Let me count them. One, two,
three, four, five&mdash;" "My dear," said her
mamma, "there are seven, and in the following
order: <i>red</i>, <i>orange</i>, <i>yellow</i>, <i>green</i>,
<i>blue</i>, <i>purple</i>, and <i>violet</i>. These colours appear
so much the more lively, according as
the cloud behind is darker, and the drops
of rain fall the closer. The Rainbow can
last only while the rain continues. The
sun must be behind us, and the rain opposite<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
to us. The sun and rain must appear at
the same time in order to form a Rainbow.
It is caused by the rays of the sun reflected
on drops of water, and is a picture the
most beautifully coloured of any the Creator
has given to us. The nearer the sun
is to setting, the wider the arch extends.
When the sun is at its greatest height, the
bow appears the smallest.</p>

<p>"Where do we read, my dear, in the
Bible about the Rainbow?" asked Julia's
mamma. "I think, mamma," replied
Julia, "it was to Noah as a sign the world
should not again be destroyed by water,
and we read so in the book of Genesis."
"Yes," answered her mamma, "my dear,
you are right. How very fearful would
Noah and his family have been whenever
they saw dark clouds arise and an appearance
of much rain, if God had not kindly
said what he intended by the Rainbow!
But he explained it by saying, 'I do set
my bow in the clouds, and it shall be for
a token of a covenant between me and the
earth. And the bow shall be in the cloud;
and I will look upon it, that I may remember
the everlasting covenant between me
and every living creature of all flesh that
is upon the earth!'<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span></p>

<p>"A bow bespeaks terror; but this has
neither string nor arrow; it is an emblem
of peace. If it had not been said that it
was a token to all generations, even <i>we</i>
should have feared a deluge whenever a
storm approached. How must Noah have
felt when he and his family left the ark, and
not a vestige of any thing remained they
had seen before! For the waters had
covered the highest mountains, and had
risen fifteen cubits higher; that is, seven
yards and a half; so that in vain would salvation
have been hoped for from the hills
and mountains. What was Noah's conduct
on leaving the ark? He did not forget (as
many do) the mercies of God which he had
received. The first thing he did was to
build an altar for the worship of God. One
would have thought, so dreary as every
thing must have appeared, his first care
would have been to build a house for himself
and family, warm and sheltered as
they had been in the ark. But no; Noah
<i>feared</i> God, and therefore his first care
was to <i>serve</i> him.</p>

<p>"May it be so, my dear, with <i>you</i>,"
continued Julia's mamma. "May <i>you</i> seek
first the kingdom of God and his righteousness,
and all other things shall be added unto<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
you! Noah's worship was accepted, and
immediately God said unto him, I will no
more destroy the world with a flood. What
kindness is here shown! I think, my love,
it is time we hastened home."</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">
<img src="images/i014.png" width="500" height="371" alt="family prayer" title="" />
</div>

<p>When they arrived at their abode, as
Julia's papa was not expected that night,
her mamma, according to her usual practice
in his absence, rang the bell for the
servants to attend family worship; and a
large family bible being laid on the table,
her mamma, with great solemnity, read the
twenty-ninth Psalm, which being done,
all kneeled, and she, in a sweet, feeling
manner, approached the throne of Mercy.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
When prayer was over, all rose from their
knees; Julia kissed her mamma, and took
her leave of her for the night. "Good
night, my dear," said her mamma; "don't
forget to pray in secret before you close
your eyes for sleep. Adieu! dear Julia;</p>

<div class='poem'>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">'May angels guard thy head,</span><br />
And through the hours of darkness keep<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Their watch around thy bed!'"</span><br />
</div>

<p>I hope, my dear young reader, you will
consider what Julia's mamma said to her
for <i>her</i> instructions and comfort about the
Storm and the Rainbow is here mentioned
for <i>your</i> instruction and comfort too on such
occasions. Only fear God, and you need
not fear any thing else.</p>

<div class='poem'>
How dreadful to hear in the sky<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The thunder so long and so loud!</span><br />
To witness the fork'd lightnings fly,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Discharged from yonder black cloud!</span><br />
Lord, mercy on me do bestow,<br />
And show me the peaceful Rainbow!<br />
<br />
In vain to shelters do I run,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">If I find no shelter in Thee;</span><br />
No threat'ning dangers can I shun,<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span><span style="margin-left: 1em;">But as Thou art gracious to me.</span><br />
Thou can'st hush my fears I well know,<br />
By showing the peaceful Rainbow.<br />
<br />
That tells me the storm shall soon end,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The earth shall be delug'd no more,</span><br />
That God is my father and friend,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Whose love is great as his power.</span><br />
His signal to creatures below<br />
Is the peaceful, lovely Rainbow.<br />
<br />
This bow is not bent by a string,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Because the anger is all fled;</span><br />
Nor has it an arrow to fling,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">So that I have nothing to dread.</span><br />
And God now would have me to know,<br />
All is <i>mercy</i> in the Rainbow.<br />
<br />
In future, then, when I'm afraid,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And darkness and storms fill the air,</span><br />
I will think that God who them made,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Views me as a child of his care;</span><br />
That storms will soon cease from below,<br />
And the sky display the Rainbow.<br />

copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.</p>

Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
<a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/license">http://www.gutenberg.org/license)</a>.


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the

Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than

posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a

form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax

     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days

both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS,' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/pglaf

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Each eBook is in a subdirectory of the same number as the eBook's
eBook number, often in several formats including plain vanilla ASCII,
compressed (zipped), HTML and others.

Corrected EDITIONS of our eBooks replace the old file and take over
the old filename and etext number.  The replaced older file is renamed.
VERSIONS based on separate sources are treated as new eBooks receiving
new filenames and etext numbers.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

<a href="http://www.gutenberg.org">http://www.gutenberg.org</a>

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.

EBooks posted prior to November 2003, with eBook numbers BELOW #10000,
are filed in directories based on their release date.  If you want to
download any of these eBooks directly, rather than using the regular
search system you may utilize the following addresses and just
download by the etext year.

<a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/etext06/">http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/etext06/</a>

    (Or /etext 05, 04, 03, 02, 01, 00, 99,
     98, 97, 96, 95, 94, 93, 92, 92, 91 or 90)

EBooks posted since November 2003, with etext numbers OVER #10000, are
filed in a different way.  The year of a release date is no longer part
of the directory path.  The path is based on the etext number (which is
identical to the filename).  The path to the file is made up of single
digits corresponding to all but the last digit in the filename.  For
example an eBook of filename 10234 would be found at:

http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/1/0/2/3/10234

or filename 24689 would be found at:
http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/2/4/6/8/24689
